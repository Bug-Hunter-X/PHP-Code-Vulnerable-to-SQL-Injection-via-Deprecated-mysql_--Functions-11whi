This code suffers from a potential issue related to the usage of the `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are deprecated and have known security vulnerabilities, making the code susceptible to SQL injection attacks. The `mysql_query` function directly uses user input without proper sanitization. 
```php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['password'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $username . "' AND password = '" . $password . "'";
$result = mysql_query($query);
```
